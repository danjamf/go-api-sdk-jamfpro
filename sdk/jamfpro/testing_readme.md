# Architectural Decision - SDK Testing Strategy

## Title:

Integration Testing Strategy for Go-Based CRUD API SDK (Focused on Sequential Resource Lifecycle Testing)

### Status:

Accepted

#### Context:

Our CRUD API SDK in Go interacts with various endpoints for resource operations such as retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion. Ensuring its reliability and robustness demands an in-depth and focused testing strategy.

#### Decision:

We will implement a detailed Integration Testing Strategy that involves HTTP requests to a test server or a mocked API environment, focusing on both basic and full resource tests for each resource type. Testing will be Implement sequentially that covers the entire lifecycle of a resource, from creation to deletion, ensuring robust validation of each SDK functionality.

#### Detailed Approach:

1. **Setup Test Environment**:
   - Set up a dedicated test server or a mocked API environment that mirrors the real API's behavior.
   - Ensure isolation from the production environment to prevent data corruption or unintended side effects.

2. **Basic Resource Tests**:
   - For each resource type, conduct basic tests that cover fundamental operations (CRUD).
   - **Create**: Test creating a resource with minimal required fields. Validate successful creation and correct response data.
   - **Read**: Test fetching resources, both by listing all and by specific identifiers (ID, name). Ensure correct data retrieval.
   - **Update**: Test updating resources, focusing on essential fields. Validate that updates are applied and correctly reflected.
   - **Delete**: Test deletion of resources by ID and name. Confirm successful deletion and appropriate handling of subsequent retrieval attempts.

3. **Full Resource Tests**:
   - Extend beyond basic tests to cover all fields and functionalities offered by the resource.
   - **Comprehensive Create**: Test creation with all possible fields, including optional ones. Validate comprehensive data persistence.
   - **Detailed Read**: Verify the retrieval of full resource details, including all attributes and nested objects if applicable.
   - **Thorough Update**: Test updates involving multiple fields, edge cases, and scenarios where dependencies exist between fields.
   - **Conditional Delete**: Test deletion scenarios under various conditions (e.g., resources linked to other entities).

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
   - Test how the SDK handles erroneous inputs, invalid states, and network issues.
   - Validate proper error messages, status codes, and rollback mechanisms where necessary.

5. **Test Data Management**:
   - Implement strategies for setting up, managing, and cleaning up test data before and after each test run.

6. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Integrate the test suite into our CI pipeline to ensure consistent execution and early issue detection.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Provide detailed documentation for each test, explaining its purpose, setup, and expected outcomes.

8. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Monitor the performance impact of the tests, optimizing where possible without compromising coverage.

#### Rationale:
The detailed integration testing strategy is selected for its ability to provide a realistic and comprehensive assessment of the SDK's functionality. By encompassing both basic and full resource tests, it ensures thorough coverage of each resource type, catering to various use cases and potential scenarios.

#### Implications:

1. **Increased Complexity**: The detailed nature of the testing requires more intricate setup and handling of various scenarios.
2. **Resource Intensiveness**: This approach might demand more time and resources for execution and maintenance.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: As the API evolves, tests need to be updated to cover new functionalities and changes.

#### Future Considerations:

Regularly review the test suite in response to SDK updates, API changes, and feedback. Consider incorporating additional types of tests, like performance or security testing, as the need arises.

### Validation and Refinement of the Proposed Test Strategy

#### Approach:

1. **Create Basic Resource**: Create a resource with minimal required fields.
2. **Create Full Resource**: Create a resource with all fields, including optional ones.
3. **Get Resources**:
   - **Serialized List**: Retrieve a list of all resources.
   - **Get by ID**: Fetch the created resources individually by their IDs.
   - **Get by Name**: Retrieve the resources using their names.
4. **Update Resources**: Update both resources by swapping their values.
5. **Delete Resources**: Finally, delete both resources to clean up test data.

#### Validation and Clarifications:

- **Sequential Dependency**: This strategy inherently depends on the successful execution of previous steps. Failure in creation, for instance, will affect subsequent tests. This sequential dependency is necessary but requires careful handling of each step.
- **Data Uniqueness**: Ensuring unique data for creation, especially for fields like 'name', is crucial to avoid conflicts and false negatives during retrieval and update tests.
- **State Preservation**: After creating resources, their initial state needs to be preserved for comparison post-updates.
- **Comprehensive Update Test**: Swapping values between resources is a robust way to ensure a full range of changes is possible. It effectively tests the update functionality's flexibility.
- **Cleanup Importance**: Deleting test resources is vital to prevent pollution of the test environment. However, it's equally important to handle deletion failures gracefully, ensuring they don't hinder subsequent test runs.

#### Risks and Limitations:

- **Test Environment Integrity**: Continuous testing might lead to state inconsistencies within the test environment. Regular resets or isolated environments for each test run could mitigate this.
- **Resource Depletion**: In scenarios where resource creation has limits (e.g., due to database constraints), repeated tests might hit these limits. Strategies for resource reuse or extensive cleanup routines are advisable.
- **Error Propagation**: Failures in early stages (creation or retrieval) could cascade, rendering later tests (update, delete) less informative. Implementing robust error handling and independent validation can alleviate this.
